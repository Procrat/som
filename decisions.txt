Evaluation
- cluster validity
  - intra-cluster / inter-cluster
- 2 SOM quality properties:
  - data representation accuracy
    -> average quantization error
     = average error between data vectors and their BMUs on the map.
  - data set topology representation accuracy
    -> Topograhic error measure:
     bv. percentage of data vectors for which the first- and second-BMUs are
         not adjacent units
  - mapping uniformity
  - ~= decent distance map / hit map
